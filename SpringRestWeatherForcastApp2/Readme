I have used spring-boot to solve this case study. As using spring-boot configuration becomes easy.
WeatherApiController class acts as a rest controller. From there request goes to WeatherService which has a method to call weather forecast api.
Weather class is POJO class.WeatherEntry class is to retrieve necessary parameters from api response. 
WeatherForcasr is POJO which takes data from Weather Entry.
WeatherAppProperties.java is used to get weather api key from application.properties.
ExceptionController and ErrorResponse acts as Exception handler classes.
